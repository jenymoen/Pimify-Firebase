# Tasks: Shopify Bi-directional Sync

> Generated from [prd-shopify-sync.md](./prd-shopify-sync.md)

## Relevant Files

*(To be completed after sub-task generation)*

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `shopify-client.ts` and `shopify-client.test.ts` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
