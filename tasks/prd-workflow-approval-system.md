# Product Requirements Document: Workflow & Approval System

## Introduction/Overview

The Workflow & Approval System is a comprehensive product management feature that introduces structured approval processes, role-based access control, and complete audit trails for product modifications. This system addresses the critical need for quality control, accountability, and traceability in product management workflows, ensuring that only properly reviewed and approved products reach the live environment.

**Problem Statement:** Currently, product changes can be made and published without proper oversight, leading to potential quality issues, unauthorized modifications, and lack of accountability for changes.

**Goal:** Implement a robust workflow system that ensures all product changes go through proper approval processes while maintaining clear audit trails and role-based access control.

## Goals

1. **Quality Assurance:** Ensure all products undergo proper review before publication
2. **Access Control:** Implement granular role-based permissions for different user types
3. **Accountability:** Provide complete audit trails for all product modifications
4. **Efficiency:** Enable bulk operations for managing multiple products simultaneously
5. **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with existing Shopify export functionality
6. **Scalability:** Support management of 1,000-10,000+ products efficiently

7. **Advanced Search:** Basic filtering only, no full-text search capabilities
8. **Workflow Templates:** No pre-configured workflow templates for different product types

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Progress Visualization:** Show workflow progress with clear visual steps
- **Role-Based Navigation:** Hide/show menu items and actions based on user permissions
- **Bulk Operations:** Implement intuitive multi-select interface with clear action buttons
- **Audit Trail Display:** Use timeline-style layout for change history with expandable details

### Component Reuse
- Leverage existing UI components from the component library
- Extend existing product cards to include workflow state indicators
- Reuse existing modal and dialog components for bulk operations
- Utilize existing table components for audit trail display

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema

- Implement role-based middleware for API endpoints
- Add permission checks to all product-related operations
- Ensure secure session management for role information

### Performance Optimization
- Implement database indexing for workflow state queries
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed role permissions
- Optimize bulk operation queries with batch processing

### Data Migration
- Migrate existing products to "Published" state by default
- Preserve existing product data without modification
- Create initial admin user with full permissions
- Set up default notification preferences for existing users
